Year 1 Semester 2 Group project University of Kelaniya.
In today's world, people face the challenge of finding the right photographer to 
capture precious moments on special occasions. Additionally, photographers lack 
easy access to engage with potential clients and share accurate information. This 
problem is getting worse during the pandemic and even now as people are unable 
to meet in person and discuss details with photographers. Additionally, 
transportation issues further hamper the process for both clients and 
photographers. Due to these circumstances and the fast-paced lifestyle of today's 
people, online platforms have become the preferred method for performing most 
of the tasks. Our software system focuses on hiring professional photographers 
and getting them to meet the clients online. The goal of this project is to develop 
an e-commerce website for an event photography management system. The 
website provides users with a list of photographers available for hire through the 
system. After registering and logging in, customers can select a suitable 
photographer from the available options. Each photographer has a separate 
account so registered users can get a glimpse of their work and contact them via a 
quote form.
